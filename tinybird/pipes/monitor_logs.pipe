DESCRIPTION >
	The `monitor_logs` API Endpoint pulls from the `copy_log` Data Source that is fed by the Copy Pipes, which get triggered every few minutes. The endpoint returns a list of anomaly detections across the set of sensors for all the anomaly types.

While this compilation is not based on up-to-the-second fresh data, this endpoint provides a single endpoint that covers the five different anomaly types with a up-to-the-minute results.
